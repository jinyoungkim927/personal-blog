## Why This Site Exists (Or Doesn't Need To)

In a world obsessed with productivity, efficiency, and optimization, we're taking a different approach. Welcome to **More Useless**, where the only KPI we track is how many times we make you go "huh, interesting... but why?"

### What Makes Something Useless?

The beautiful thing about uselessness is that it's entirely subjective. What's useless to you might be... well, also useless to me. But that's the point! We're celebrating:

- **Facts that won't help you in trivia night** — Did you know that honey never spoils? Archaeologists have found 3000-year-old honey that's still edible. This information will never help you in life, but now you know it forever.

- **Solutions to non-problems** — Like creating an app that counts how many times you've opened the fridge without taking anything out.

- **Overthinking simple things** — Why do we say "after dark" when it's actually after light?

### The Philosophy of Pointlessness

There's something liberating about embracing the useless. In a way, the most human things we do are the most pointless ones:

- We doodle in margins
- We arrange our food before eating it
- We give inanimate objects names
- We collect things that have no value

None of these serve any evolutionary purpose, yet they make us who we are.

### What's Coming

This site is under construction, which is fitting because construction implies building something useful, which we're definitely not doing. But here's what's planned:

1. **The Useless Facts Archive** — A growing collection of information you'll never need
2. **Overthought Essays** — Deep dives into shallow topics
3. **Pointless Projects** — Things we built because we could, not because we should
4. **Random Generators** — Because sometimes you need a random excuse for being late that involves quantum physics

### Join the Uselessness

If you've made it this far, congratulations! You've successfully wasted several minutes of your day. That's the spirit!

Stay tuned for more wonderfully pointless content. Or don't. It really doesn't matter either way.
