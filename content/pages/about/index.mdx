Hi, I'm Jin, a quantitative researcher at a hedge fund. 

Previously, I studied maths, wrote a book on anti-racism ([The Anti-Racism Kit](https://publishing.hardiegrant.com/en-us/books/the-anti-racism-kit-by-jinyoung-kim/9781761211171)), and worked on computer vision at a drone startup trying to win the war in Ukraine ([White Stork Project](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahemerson/2024/01/23/eric-schmidts-secret-white-stork-project-aims-to-build-ai-combat-drones/)).

I love learning, especially what is [orthogonal](/on-orthogonality/) to what I've experienced.
