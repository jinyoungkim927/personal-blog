Hi! I'm [Jin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jinkim2/), a quantitative researcher at a hedge fund. 

Previously, I studied maths, wrote [a book on anti-racism](https://publishing.hardiegrant.com/en-au/books/the-anti-racism-kit-by-jinyoung-kim/9781761211171), worked on computer vision at [a drone startup](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahemerson/2024/01/23/eric-schmidts-secret-white-stork-project-aims-to-build-ai-combat-drones/) trying to win the war in Ukraine, and did [AI](https://cs.stanford.edu/~ermon/website/) [research](https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io).

I love learning (<AnimatedUseless text="useless" inline />) things, especially when it is [orthogonal](https://more-useless.com/orthogonality/) to what I know.
