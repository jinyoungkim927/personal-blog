## Welcome to More Useless

Sometimes the internet takes itself too seriously. This is not one of those times.

**More Useless** is a digital sanctuary for things that serve no practical purpose whatsoever. A celebration of the wonderfully pointless, the delightfully absurd, and the curiously unnecessary.

### What You'll Find Here

- Random thoughts that probably should have stayed in the shower
- Facts nobody asked for (but you'll remember forever)
- Overthinking simple things to an unnecessary degree
- Solutions to problems that don't exist
- Collections of things that shouldn't be collected

### Why Though?

Because not everything needs to be optimized, growth-hacked, or AI-powered. Sometimes it's nice to just enjoy something simply because it exists, not because it's useful.

### Under Construction

This site is currently being assembled with the same level of care and precision as a house of cards in a wind tunnel. More useless content coming soon.
