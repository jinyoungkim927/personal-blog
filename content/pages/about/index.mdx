Hi! I'm [Jin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jinkim2/), a quantitative researcher at Two Sigma.

Previously, I studied maths at Stanford, wrote [a nationally award winning book on anti-racism](https://creative.gov.au/news-events/news/announcing-shortlists-2025-prime-ministers-literary-awards), worked on computer vision at [a stealth drone startup](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahemerson/2024/01/23/eric-schmidts-secret-white-stork-project-aims-to-build-ai-combat-drones/) trying to win the war in Ukraine, and did AI research at the [Ermon group](https://cs.stanford.edu/~ermon/website/) and [Stanford ML group](https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io).

I love learning (<AnimatedUseless text="useless" inline />) things, especially when it is [orthogonal](https://more-useless.com/orthogonality/) to what I know.
