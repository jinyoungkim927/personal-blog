**Commodity Futures**
- Evolved alongside commodity trading to support price risk management
- Physical traders use futures to hedge against adverse price movement 
- The possibility of physical delivery imposes an important price discipline on futures markets - price of commodity future and of underlying physical commodities converges as delivery date approaches
- But, physical delivery against futures contracts never happen in practice. 
	- Sellers close out positions by buying back equivalent number of contracts at the exchange on or before the delivery date 
- Futures traders maintain a cash buffer or **margin** for each contract they own 
	- Protects them against risk of credit default 
	- Profits and losses are recalculated daily and the margin is adjusted accordingly 
	- They must have sufficient margin at the start of each trading session
	- **P&L recalculated daily and margin account is adjusted** 
**Where, when what**
- End users buy physical commodities that have to satisfy: 
	- Where: Delivery location
	- When: Delivery timing
	- What: The product quality or grade 
- Commodity trading firms bridge gaps between producers and consumers based on transformations in space - time and form
	- Delivery, storage, blending 
- **Owning vs. Selling contract**
	- Long/short
	- Limit/market order
### Trading Logistics: 
- General Trading Logistics
- LME Warehouses (biggest contracts)
	- If you forget, expire, seller must deliver and store in pre-approved warehouse (Warrant) 
	- Type in `LMEI` into the Bloomberg terminal 
- Warrant vs. Option
	- How does a warrant work?
	- It's a lot number to a specific part of the actual product (your claim/deed to it)

### Market Opportunities in Aluminum

### Example of a Trade that went wrong: 
- It's September. You want to short the February futures contracts, because it seems overpriced
	- Gas production and consumption have been stable, so volatility is low. Optimizer tells you to load this bad boy up with huge volume. 
- But! If December was a very cold winter, risk can shoot up massively. 
- So, what if you had hedged by running: 
	- June 2016 Natural Gas Long $2B
	- February 2016 Natural Gas Short $2B
