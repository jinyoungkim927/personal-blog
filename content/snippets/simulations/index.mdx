Jim Fan (Nvidia) view on simulations (thanks Andy Xu): 
- You do not create one extremely high fidelity simulation. 
- Instead you create multiple low fidelity simulations that focus on one characteristic of the environment, and train your RL agent in multiple of these simulations. 
	- One interesting aspect of simulations is the 'averaging aspect' of where you simply take the average of random gravity parameters that you tweak for instance, and then run it.
- One viewpoint is additional Regularization on your trained model, another viewpoint that is equivalent is one of Robustness.
