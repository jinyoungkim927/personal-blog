Game theory is a framework for reasoning about strategic interactions—situations where your best choice depends on what others do, and vice versa.

The core insight is that in many real situations, you can't optimize in isolation. Whether you're a firm deciding on pricing, a country considering trade policy, or a person deciding whether to cooperate with a colleague, the "right" move depends on anticipating how others will respond.

### Key Concepts

**Nash Equilibrium**: A state where no player can improve their outcome by unilaterally changing their strategy. Everyone's best response is already what they're doing. It's not necessarily optimal for the group—just stable.

**Dominant Strategy**: A choice that's best regardless of what others do. These are rare but powerful when they exist.

**Prisoner's Dilemma**: The classic example of how individual rationality leads to collective irrationality. Both players defect even though mutual cooperation would be better for both.

### Currency Attack Model

A practical application: imagine speculators considering whether to attack a currency peg. Each speculator's decision depends on whether enough others will join. If enough attack, the central bank can't defend the peg and everyone profits. If too few attack, the peg holds and attackers lose money.

This creates multiple equilibria—the attack succeeds if everyone expects it to succeed, and fails if everyone expects it to fail. Expectations become self-fulfilling.

### Why It Matters

Game theory doesn't tell you what to do—it tells you what questions to ask. Who are the players? What are their payoffs? Can they coordinate? Can they commit to strategies? Is this a one-shot game or repeated?

The real skill is recognizing when a situation is strategic and requires this kind of thinking, versus when you can optimize independently.
