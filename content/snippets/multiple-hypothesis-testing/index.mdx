Goal: Assess individual hypotheses <Math>{"H_1, \\dots, H_n"}</Math> (e.g., for each feature/variable).  

Procedures aim to control metrics like False Discovery Rate (FDR), FWER, etc.  
Result: Accept some hypotheses, reject others.  
Output: A decision vector <Math>{"(\\text{accept}, \\text{reject}, \\dots)"}</Math> across hypotheses.  

Bonferroni's method controls FWER at level <Math>{"\\alpha"}</Math> in the strong sense.

Weak control:
- 2 Step procedure
	- Global test like Bonferroni's method
	- Then test each hypothesis at level <Math>{"\\alpha"}</Math> 

Strong control:

Closure Procedure
