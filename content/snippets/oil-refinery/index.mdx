Good summary in Oil Refinery Runs
### What is a Refinery: 
- It makes:*[Image: Pasted image 20240702165842.png]*

### Refinery Economics: 

- 4 stages. Check out Oil Refining Process 
	- **5 types of refineries:** 
		- Basic topping
			- Least sophisticated
			- Separates components with distillation, very few. China has over 100. 
			- Topping refineries often rely on selling half finished stuff to otheer refineries with excess downstream capacity 
		- Hydroskimming refineries 
			- Naptha reformers, reformers generate hydrogen, this can be skimmed off for use in desulfurization units like hydrotreaters. A refiner can begin to increase octane of gasoline with reformate, lower sulfur of light distillate productiton 
		- Cracking refineries
			- Catalytic cracking units like FCC + hydrocracker
		- Coking refineries
			- Also have cokes
		- Full conversion/complex refineries
			- Coking refineries with steam cracker, to produce ethylene and propylene (most plastics) -> oil refinery + petrochemical plant 
### Questions: 
- **How often do they get built + lifespan?**
	- 1. Infrequent. Typically takes several years to plan, design, obtain permits. Complex regulatory requirements. 
	- Average is between 30 - 50 years 
- **What are the feedstock/inputs to refineries? How sensitive is the refinery based on the input quality of the feedstocks? Do some refineries get better feedstock than others for systemic reasons?** 
	- Feedstock composition: 
		- Crude oils (light sweet, heavy sour)
			- Weight (unit API Gravity. Higher weight is lower API gravity)
				- Heavy oil evaporates slowly. Used to make asphalt. 
				- Light oil doesn't require much processing, more gasoline
			- Sweetness (amount of sulfur, sweet has little sulfur)
				- Sweet: less than 1%
				- Sour: More than 1% 
					- Roughly 5-10% cheaper? 
				- Need extra treating to take this out (a new HDS unit can cost hundreds of millions of dollars), varies widely based on capacity, feed properties, desired sulfur reduction)
			- TAN count (how corrosive, total acid number)
				- Higher TAN is bad, need more robust Metallurgy
				- Maintenance, piping (stainless steel/alloys), other infra costs, environmental compliance 
		- (These optimise yield of high value outputs + give you flexibility + supply chain optimisation + environmental + regulation)
		- Other Petroleum (condensates, natural gas liquids) (not necessary, but useful)
			- Processed in refineries for gasoline and NAFTA
			- For NGL (propane, butane, ethane) for petrochemical feedstocks
		- Non petroleum (biofeestocks, recycled plastics) (not necessary, but useful)
			- Biofeedstocks often used to meet regulatory requirements
			- Recycled plastics, synthetic stuff
- **Only all US refineries have more coking and cracking capabilities - what are they and why are they important?** 
	- **Why relevant**: 
		- More high octane gasoline, higher prices (guessing prices your car runs on)
		- Regional octane requirement can influence international gasoline trade
			- ex) European Union vs. United States (EU minimum octane is 95 RON, regular gasoline has 87 AKI or 91 RON). So gasoline US may not meet EU standards. Refineries in the US need to produce higher octane gasoline. US refineries spend more on refineries or not. 
			- ex) Japan high octane requirement (minimum is 91, premium requires 98 RON). Japanese vehicles meant to run on higher gasoline which influences trade.
			- Gallons different (UK vs. US) 168 vs 120 
		- Environmental regulations often affect octane-boosting methods, influencing refinery operations and gasoline blending strategies. Vehicle fleet requirements different. 
	- Breaking down heavy long-chain hydrocarbons into lighter more valuable products

		Coking
