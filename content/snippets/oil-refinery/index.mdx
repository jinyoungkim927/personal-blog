An oil refinery converts crude oil into usable products—gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, heating oil, asphalt, and petrochemical feedstocks. Understanding refineries matters for energy trading and commodities investing.

### What Refineries Produce

The main outputs, roughly by volume:
- Gasoline (~45%): for cars
- Diesel/heating oil (~25%): trucks, trains, ships, home heating
- Jet fuel (~10%): aviation
- Residual fuel oil: ships, power plants
- Petrochemicals: plastics, chemicals

The exact split depends on the refinery configuration and the crude input.

### Crude Oil Matters

Not all crude is the same. Two key properties:

**API Gravity** (weight): Light crude (high API) yields more gasoline with less processing. Heavy crude (low API) requires more complex refining but is cheaper.

**Sulfur content**: Sweet crude (< 1% sulfur) is easier to process. Sour crude (> 1% sulfur) needs desulfurization, which requires expensive hydrotreating units.

Light sweet crude commands a premium. Heavy sour is 5-10% cheaper but requires a more sophisticated refinery to process profitably.

### Refinery Complexity

Refineries range from simple to complex:

1. **Topping**: Basic distillation only. Just separates crude into components. Common in developing markets.

2. **Hydroskimming**: Adds reformers and hydrotreaters. Can adjust octane levels and reduce sulfur.

3. **Cracking**: Has catalytic crackers (FCC) or hydrocrackers. Breaks heavy molecules into lighter, valuable products.

4. **Coking**: Processes the heaviest residues. Maximizes light product yield.

5. **Full conversion**: Integrated refinery + petrochemical plant. Makes everything from gasoline to plastics.

More complex refineries can profitably process cheaper heavy/sour crudes and adapt their output mix to market conditions.

### Refinery Economics

**Crack spread**: The difference between the price of refined products and crude oil. This is the refinery's gross margin.

A "3-2-1 crack" = (2 × gasoline price + 1 × diesel price) / 3 - crude price

When crack spreads are high, refineries are profitable. When they compress, margins suffer.

**What drives crack spreads:**
- Product demand (seasonal—gasoline peaks in summer driving season)
- Refinery capacity utilization
- Crude supply and quality
- Regulations (sulfur limits, octane requirements)

### Regional Differences

Octane standards vary globally. EU requires 95 RON minimum; US regular is 87 AKI (≈91 RON). This affects which refineries can export to which markets.

US refineries tend to be more complex (more cracking/coking capacity) because they process a lot of heavy crude from Canada and Latin America.

### Investment Considerations

Refineries take years to build and last 30-50 years. New construction is rare in developed markets due to regulations and NIMBY opposition.

Refinery stocks aren't pure oil plays—they benefit from volatility in crude/product spreads, not just high oil prices. Sometimes they do well when crude crashes if products hold up better.
