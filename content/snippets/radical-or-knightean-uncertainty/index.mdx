**What is it**
- Assigning a distribution is fraught because you don't have info
- The insight here is that there is a difference between Risk vs Uncertainty
- The quote goes: 
---
"Uncertainty must be taken in a sense radically distinct from the familiar notion of Risk, from which it has never been properly separated.... **The essential fact is that 'risk' means in some cases a quantity susceptible of measurement**, while at other times it is something distinctly not of this character; and there are far-reaching and crucial differences in the bearings of the phenomena depending on which of the two is really present and operating.... It will appear that a measurable uncertainty, or 'risk' proper, as we shall use the term, **is so far different from an unmeasurable one that it is not in effect an uncertainty at all.**"

**A new conception of why profit is made**

1. **Unquantifiable Uncertainty**: It is impossible to assign probabilities to outcomes.
2. **Decision Making**: In the face of Knightian uncertainty, decision-making strategies may rely more on heuristics, rules of thumb, or other non-probabilistic methods.
3. **Business Innovation & Entrepreneurship**: Knight argued that profits are a reward for bearing uncertainty, not risk, hence fostering entrepreneurship.
